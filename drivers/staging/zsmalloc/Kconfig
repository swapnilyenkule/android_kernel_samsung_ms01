	  zsmalloc is a slab-based memory allocator designed to store
	  compressed RAM pages.  zsmalloc uses virtual memory mapping
	  in order to reduce fragmentation.  However, this results in a
	  non-standard allocator interface where a handle, not a pointer, is
	  returned by an alloc().  This handle must be mapped in order to
	  access the allocated space.
